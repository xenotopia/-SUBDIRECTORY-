# Altair Visualizations for Building Inventory Dataset

Welcome to the visualization project page! Below are the visualizations I created using Python, Altair, and Vega-Lite.

## Visualization 1: Building Types
This bar chart shows the count of different building types in the dataset.

## Visualization 2: Age vs. Size
This scatter plot shows the relationship between building age and size.
